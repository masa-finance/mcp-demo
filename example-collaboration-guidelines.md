# Collaboration Rules for Building the Masa X API MCP

1.  **Objective:** Define and implement an MCP-compliant API for Masa X using the `mcp-go` library.
2.  **Technology:** 
    * Use Go and the `github.com/mark3labs/mcp-go` library.
    * Use the Masa X API to access X data  https://developers.masa.ai/docs/index-API/masa-api-search 
3.  **MCP Focus:** Prioritize correct MCP implementation, defining resources, prompts, and tools according to the Masa X API functionalities. Ensure adherence to MCP specifications.
4.  **Simplicity First:** Keep the implementation direct and avoid unnecessary complexity. Changes should be minimal and targeted.
5.  **Code Standards:**
    *   Write idiomatic Go code.
    *   Follow Go best practices (e.g., effective Go).
    *   Keep code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
    *   Provide complete functions or relevant code blocks for clarity.
6.  **Communication:** Explain steps and reasoning. Ask questions or provide direction if needed.
7.  **Tool Use:** Use available tools (read, search, edit) as needed, explaining the purpose.
8.  **Commit Messages:** Use standard conventions (e.g., Conventional Commits) if needed.
